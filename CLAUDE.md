# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# IMPORTANT!!!: KEEP IT SIMPLE, DON'T OVER ENGINEERING! USE Poetry for python

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
